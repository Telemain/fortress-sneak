# fortress-sneak

This was a very simple game that I created for a class. As I was in the coding oriented track I woried less about models, animations, and the appearance of the level and opted instead just to make it dark to obscure the lack of fine details as best I could.
My emphasis was on coding the movement, colision, and detection of the spotlights on the player.
